        <p id="homepara">
            I am Dhanush Sanjay Nidamanuri, an undergraduate student (Batch 2024-28) in the Computer Science
             and Engineering department at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay).
            Currently, I reside in Hostel-1. This website is developed as part of CS104, a core
             course in the second semester of the undergraduate curriculum. 
            <br><br>
            Through this project, I aim to apply and enhance my web development skills while 
            gaining hands-on experience with HTML and CSS as required for the course.
            I am passionate about technology, problem-solving, and software development, and I look forward
            to expanding my knowledge and working on exciting projects in the future.
